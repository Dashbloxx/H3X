# H3X
## About
More information will be here in the future. Use this for educational purposes only!
## Requirements
To build & run H3X, you will need a C compiler, and be running on a UNIX-like system that supports BSD sockets. If you're running linux or *BSD, you are most likely able to build and run H3X on your system. You'll also need either GNU make, or BSD make.
## Building
To build H3X, just run `make`. You will then have a binary named `h3x`, which is the final product.
